						<h1>The Cultural Problem</h1>
                        
                        <hr>

						<h2>Merely 70 years ago you’d have to travel the world to gain insight into new cultures. But now that you can find a massive variety of cultures around your neighborhood, there’s no longer need for long distance travel. For those who are ready to meet new cultures, no matter the reason, we now introduce a brand-new application: CultureMates!

								<p style="width: 100%;">What is a culture? Many might believe the religious differences are the parts that make up the culture. But there’s so much more to a culture than what the surface might show. Art, music, dance, rituals, cooking and clothing are just a few of many aspects that vary from different cultures. The evolution of technology has made it possible to share and gain information about almost anything; but only having a fragment of the information and reading about other people’s experiences leads to prejudices, especially here in Norway, where the society already is quite withdrawn and closed. Having these prejudices enforces the barriers between cultures and divides our society. These cultural barriers might be one of the strongest social barriers we have.<br><br>
In our current state of society, immigration is increasing and people come from every region of the world to represent an incredible array of linguistic and cultural heritages. In this humongous amount of cultural mix, immigrants and refugees tend to stay in larger groups amongst themselves and dwell in their comfort zones. This and the language barriers lead to major problems in their integration process. It’s hard to start a new chapter in life in a new country, but it’s even harder when the possibilities are limited.
<br><br> When all these new cultures meet, we see the necessity to better understand one another’s cultures. Having all these new cultures so close to our home can be frightening for some, while others might look at this as an opportunity to experience something new and different from our daily lives. Whether you want to learn about new cultures, teach someone about your culture or help reduce xenophobia, CultureMates is the application for you!

							<p style="width: 100%; color: white;"><strong>There is a saying that says, “If you know someone by their personality and not by their appearance, your relationship with them will last longer”. The purpose of our technology is to help people reach out to others.</strong> We want to create a connection between people who are less comfortable with meeting other people, and help them create a bond based on their interests and mutual respect. It is easy to judge a book by its cover, and never even bother to read it. That is why we want people to read the book before they see the cover. Considering these factors, we decided we wanted to develop an app to simplify breaking the ice; the puropse being to let people match with others based on their interests instead of their appearance. “Anonymity” is a big keyword for our app; we want to let users hide their identity until they are comfortable revealing themselves. We believe that this will encourage people to open up and bond with others.</p>
							<p style="width: 100%; color: white;">Despite the main focus being on creating new friendships, the foundation of this app is based on giving people who might otherwise feel lonely, isolated or not understood, an online place to find like-minded or new friends in their area. We all know how making new friends can be such a demanding task when starting in a new school, or how it almost seems impossible to find others who share the same interests as you, albeit those being a bit peculiar or not considered as "normal". We want to help everyone connect with the people they want, without being judged based on appearance.</p>

								<h3>CREATE PROFILE</h3>
								<p>The first step is to create a profile. During this step, you will form your identity in a fun, but anonymous way. First, you need to fill in your name, age, location and add a real picture of you. Personal information remains hidden from others. <span id="section1-show-more" style="font-size: 0;">Then you create an avatar and choose your interests from different categories. Users are now able to look you up.</span>

							<div class="viddeLosning">
								<img src="./CultureMate - Meet cultures easier_files/iPhone3.png" alt="Icon of a portable device">
								<h3>FILTER</h3>
								<p>Filter through the categories to specify and refine your search. In this step, you can either filter with categories that match or do not match your traits. No personal information will be displayed.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="viddeLosning">
								<img src="./CultureMate - Meet cultures easier_files/iPhone2.png" alt="Icon of a nut">
								<h3>SWIPE</h3>
								<p>After you have filtered out the categories you like, a list of profiles will appear. Swipe through this list to find someone of interest. Once there, you tap on the profile, and you can start a conversation.

							<h2>Connecting the world.</h2>
							<p style="width: 100%;"><strong>After you have done these three steps, you have a “contacts list” of people that have accepted your friend requests.</strong> You will be able to write to these persons and have a conversation with them. After a while, you can unlock parts of your personal information to the other person. You can for example reveal your real name, or your profile picture. In the end, you will both know each other’s real identity and it is up to you to continue your relationship.</p>
